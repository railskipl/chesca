= How to update the front page

Since this doesn't happen too often the frontpage doesn't have an UI for updating,
so it has to be manual.

In general all that's needed is change a few images and URLs.

In order to keep it clean, there's a special directory under:

  <APP_ROOT>/public/images/homepage

Which in turn contains various subdirectories, each containing the images of a
given season.

A common problem is that Nico's new images tend not to be the exact sizes as the
previous batch, so sometimes some manual cropping or resizing needs to be done
to fix the offset of a few pixels that tends to appear.

The main (big) image has to be 579 pixels wide and 528 pixels tall.

The side (small) images have to be 212 pixles wide and either 261 or 266 pixels
tall (the sum of both make for the perfect height in the page).

Make sure the images are saved in JPEG format with quality at 80-90%. Never use
PNGs.

To add new images simply create a new subdirectory under homepage/ with the
name of the new season (try to keep names lowercase and without spaces), and
drop the new images there.

The front page view is found in:

  <APP_ROOT>/app/views/main/index.html.haml

To change the images open that file with a text editor. If possible, try using
an advanced text editor that allows setting newline characters, and set them to
UNIX format.

At the top of the file there are some variable definitions. In order to change
the banners all that needs to be edited are the values of those variables.

The first variable, season_directory, is the name of the new directory you
created for the new images. Change it accordingly.

Next are 5 variables which define each banner. Each variable contains two
values, 1) the name of the image and 2) where to link to (an URL or a
resource).

If any new resources are needed you'll have to edit the controller, found in:

  <APP_ROOT>/app/controllers/main_controller.rb

There you can create new resources such as styles or departments by name.

Once you're done save the files. It's better if you run a local server to
make sure your changes are correct.

Finally add and commit all your changes to git (don't forget to add the new
images), and finally deploy to the server with this command:

  cap production deploy
